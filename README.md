BLOCK-CHAIN TUTORIAL
> PROJECT: "SHARKBYTE"
>> PHASE: 1
>> DESCRIPTION: Sharkbyte is a blockchain that ensures transaction security. With every coin traded (coin dependent) a SharkByte" is generated and provisioned to the buyer ensuring that ownership & vendor meta-data is attributed on every exchange.
>> 
>> Using the 'SharkByte' lockchain as a security layer ensures each block and sub-block traded was and is owned by legitimate third-parties either officiated through legal business deisgnations or as legal third-party owners.
>>>
>>> The basis is that exchange is faciliated by contractual trust. SharkByte reconciles risk by guaranteeing to whatever degree is realistic, vendors are reputable & are sole guarantors of a transaction; meaning, the money transacted does not represent ill-acquired gains in any regard.
